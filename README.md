# Simple Platform Game

### What is it?

A simple project of mine based on external framework which I used for educational purpose and have no rights to share. Maybe in some time I will create my own version of it and share it in this repo, but for now only a code part written by me and used assets in project are shared within this repo.

### What is it about?

It is about a ninja jumping on platforms, getting rid of bombs along his way, collecting coins and avoiding projectiles dropped at player. An inspiration for this game was one called "Doodle Jump" about a funny drawn character jumping over platforms. A screenshot showing attained gameplay is shown below.

### Will there be any updates?

Probably not since it is one of my old projects that had been on my computer for years now and I have not even remembered that code of it is still safe and sound, but since I found it on my drive I wanted to secure it as a reminder where had I been as a programmer and see if I had made any progress (hopefully I did).
